Description:
I made a unix script that sets up an kernel developing environment fully automated. The script includes the good version of java (since the packages are not available trough apt-get) and the i9001 Kernel source (with adjusted makefile, ariesve_defconfig and the wifi drivers). This script may save you a lot of time, after the script is finished you will have a ready-to-mod kernel source. This script should be only used on a x64 machine (x86 will result in a corrupt environment)

(total process make take upto 30 min, depending on your connection speed)

(Please remind that I'm a unix noob, so If you find an error or missing package or w.e. please let me know!)
Made it on Mint Linux, but it should work for Ubuntu also.


What actions does it perform?
- Installing Java
- Getting required packages
- Installing Repo
- Cloning Prebuilt Repository (compiler)
- Extracting I9001 Kernel Source
- Copying ARIESVE_DEFCONFIG to source root (you can also pull config.gz from your phone "adb pull /proc/config.gz" then unzip it and copy the config file to .config (cp config .config)
- Run xconfig from kernel source after setup (optionally)


Installation Instructions:
1. Open Terminal Emulator, enter the following commands:
-- "mkdir -p ~/envsetup"
-- "cd ~/envsetup"
-- "wget http://broodplank.net/files/auto_build_env_setup.tar.gz"
-- "tar xvfz auto_build_env_setup.tar.gz"
-- "chmod +x setup.sh"
2. Now enter this command to start the script:
-- "./setup.sh"
3. After the script is done you will have a working android kernel development environment
4. You can find additional patches and scripts in the 'Patches & Addons' folder, use it!


What to do with the kernel afterwards? 
- To configure: chmod +x xconfig && ./xconfig
- To clean the source: make clean
- To compile (quick): make -j8
- To compile (extended): chmod +x compile && ./compile

the zImage will be placed in /arch/arm/boot/

Adding things such as governors/io schedulers can be learned by browsing commits of other kernel developers (on github)
